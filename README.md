to use this, remove the comment tags, then any other non essential details, then follow the link at the bottom of the file, and download the core, then use the single variable that the tool uses for pathfinding. this will eventually be streamlined once i get all the maps complete. and then you just copy gamemode code, and its ready for importing to your gamemode. till then, hope this helps!
