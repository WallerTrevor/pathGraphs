Overwatch-workshop-pathfinding-complete
to use this, remove the comment tags, then any other non essential details, then follow the link at the bottom of the file, and download the core, then use the single variable that the tool uses for pathfinding. this will eventually be streamlined once i get all the maps complete. and then you just copy gamemode code, and its ready for importing to your gamemode. till then, hope this helps!

Note: the maps were done in skirmish, and the expectation was that the spawn rooms were not to be included, please keep that in mind when using these, as most spawn points arent included. Also, the payload doorways were not inlcuded as well. so if your bots need to navigate with the payload, then the graph will need a quick edit. 

to edit these, just put one of these files into the main editor system where it has arrows pointing to in the first and 2nd rule at the top of the workshop settings page.
